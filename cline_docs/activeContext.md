# Active Context

## Current Task

Plan a web application designed to serve Markdown documentation located in the `/media/mu6mula/Data1/AI-Stuff/Markdown-Web-Docs/docs` directory.

## Requirements

1.  Read Markdown files from the specified `docs/` directory.
2.  Convert Markdown content to HTML for display in a web browser.
3.  Do **not** modify the original Markdown files.
4.  Provide a web interface for navigation and viewing.

## Current Phase

Architectural Planning: Defining the technology stack, project structure, core components, and outlining the implementation steps.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized Memory Bank (created `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## Next Steps (Planning Phase)

1.  Propose and justify a technology stack.
2.  Define the project directory structure.
3.  Outline core application components.
4.  Summarize the plan and propose next implementation steps.
5.  Present the plan for review using `attempt_completion`.

## Next Steps (Post-Planning)

-   Await user approval of the plan.
-   Create `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` based on the approved plan.
-   Switch to an implementation mode (e.g., Code mode) to build the application according to the plan.
