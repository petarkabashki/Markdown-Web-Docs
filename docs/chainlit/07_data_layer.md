# Chapter 7: Data Layer

In [Chapter 6: Session Management](06_session_management.md), we learned how Chainlit keeps track of individual user interactions using temporary sessions and the `cl.user_session` dictionary. That's great for remembering things during a single visit, like a user's name.

But what happens when the user closes their browser and comes back tomorrow? All that temporary session data is gone! How can we make our application remember conversations permanently? How can we store user profiles or keep track of feedback across sessions?

This is where the **Data Layer** comes in. Think of it as your application's **long-term memory** or its **filing cabinet**.

## What is the Data Layer? Why Do I Need It?

The Data Layer is an abstraction in Chainlit responsible for **saving** (persisting) and **loading** (retrieving) your application's important data. This primarily includes:

*   **Chat Threads:** The entire history of a conversation.
*   **Messages (Steps):** Individual messages and internal [Steps](03_step.md) within a conversation.
*   **Elements:** Files or images ([Element](04_element.md)) associated with messages/steps.
*   **User Information:** Details about registered users (if using authentication).
*   **Feedback:** User ratings or comments on messages.

The **main use case** for the Data Layer is enabling **persistence** – making sure data isn't lost when the app restarts or when a user ends their session. This allows features like:

*   **Chat History:** Users can close the chat and resume their conversation later exactly where they left off.
*   **User Accounts:** Storing user profiles and linking conversations to specific users.
*   **Persistent Feedback:** Saving feedback so you can analyze it later.

Without a data layer, your chat application has amnesia – it forgets everything once the session ends. With a data layer, it can remember.

## How Does It Work? Managed vs. Custom

Chainlit offers two main ways to handle data persistence:

1.  **Managed Data Layer (The Easy Way):**
    *   You connect your app to a pre-built persistence service. Chainlit provides integrations for:
        *   **Database:** Setting a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (e.g., pointing to a PostgreSQL database). Chainlit's built-in `ChainlitDataLayer` handles all the SQL operations automatically.
        *   **Literal AI:** Setting a `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable. Chainlit's built-in `LiteralDataLayer` saves data to the Literal AI platform.
    *   **Benefit:** Minimal setup! You configure the connection (URL or API key), and Chainlit automatically saves and loads chat history, messages, etc. **This is the recommended approach for most beginners.**

2.  **Custom Data Layer (The Flexible Way):**
    *   You write your own Python code to handle saving and loading data, perhaps to a specific NoSQL database, a custom API, or a local file system.
    *   You use the `@cl.data_layer` decorator on a function that returns your custom data layer implementation.
    *   **Benefit:** Complete control over where and how data is stored.
    *   **Downside:** Requires more coding effort and understanding of the `BaseDataLayer` interface.

Let's focus on the easy way first.

## Using the Managed Data Layer (Database Example)

Imagine you want users to be able to see their past conversations. The simplest way is to use Chainlit's built-in database integration.

**Setup:**

1.  **Have a Database:** You need a running database server that's compatible (like PostgreSQL). You can often get one for free or cheap from cloud providers.
2.  **Get the URL:** Find the connection URL for your database. It looks something like `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`.
3.  **Set Environment Variable:** Before running your Chainlit app, set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your database connection URL.
    *   On Linux/macOS: `export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."`
    *   On Windows (Command Prompt): `set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."`
    *   On Windows (PowerShell): `$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."`
4.  **Run Chainlit:** Run your app as usual: `chainlit run app.py -w` (the `-w` flag helps Chainlit pick up environment variable changes).

**What Happens Automatically?**

That's it! If `DATABASE_URL` is set, Chainlit automatically detects it and enables its built-in `ChainlitDataLayer`. Now, whenever messages, steps, or elements are created or updated in your app, Chainlit will *also* save them to your database behind the scenes.

When a user reconnects, Chainlit will check the database for existing conversations associated with them and load the history.

**Example Code (No Changes Needed!)**

Consider our simple echo bot from [Chapter 1: Callbacks & Hooks](01_callbacks___hooks.md):

```python
# app.py
import chainlit as cl

@cl.on_message
async def main(message: cl.Message):
    # This code doesn't need to change!
    response_content = f"You said: {message.content}"
    await cl.Message(content=response_content).send()

```

If you run this app *with* `DATABASE_URL` set:

1.  User sends "Hello". App replies "You said: Hello". (Chainlit saves both messages to the DB).
2.  User sends "How are you?". App replies "You said: How are you?". (Chainlit saves these messages too).
3.  User closes the browser tab.
4.  User reopens the app later.
5.  **Result:** The chat window automatically shows the previous conversation: "Hello", "You said: Hello", "How are you?", "You said: How are you?". The data layer loaded it from the database!

You get chat history **without writing any extra Python code** specifically for saving or loading.

*(Note: The Literal AI integration using `LITERAL_API_KEY` works similarly – set the key, and Chainlit automatically persists data to Literal AI).*

## A Peek at Custom Data Layers (Advanced)

What if you need to store data in a very specific way, maybe in a different type of database like MongoDB, or integrate with your company's existing data storage? You can define a custom data layer.

1.  **Define a Class:** Create a Python class that inherits from `chainlit.data.BaseDataLayer`. You'll need to implement methods like `create_step`, `get_thread`, `update_thread`, etc., to handle the actual saving and loading logic for your specific storage.

2.  **Use the Decorator:** Decorate a function with `@cl.data_layer`. This function should return an instance of your custom class.

```python
# app.py
import chainlit as cl
from chainlit.data.base import BaseDataLayer
from typing import List, Optional, Dict # etc.

# --- This is a simplified dummy implementation ---
class MyCustomDataLayer(BaseDataLayer):
    # You would implement methods here to interact with your database/storage
    async def create_step(self, step_dict: Dict):
        print(f"DUMMY: Pretending to save step: {step_dict.get('id')}")
        # Add your actual database saving code here
        pass

    async def get_thread(self, thread_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
        print(f"DUMMY: Pretending to load thread: {thread_id}")
        # Add your actual database loading code here
        # For this dummy example, return None means no history
        return None

    # ... implement all other required methods from BaseDataLayer ...
    async def get_user(self, identifier: str) -> Optional[Dict]: return None
    async def create_user(self, user: Dict) -> Optional[Dict]: return None
    # ... and many more ...

# --- Use the decorator ---
@cl.data_layer
def get_my_data_layer():
    print("Initializing MyCustomDataLayer...")
    # Return an instance of your custom class
    return MyCustomDataLayer()

# --- Your regular Chainlit app logic ---
@cl.on_message
async def main(message: cl.Message):
    await cl.Message(content=f"Echo: {message.content}").send()

```

**Explanation:**

*   We define `MyCustomDataLayer` inheriting from `BaseDataLayer`. We'd need to fill in *all* the required methods (like `create_step`, `get_thread`, `upsert_feedback`, etc.) with code that talks to our specific database. (Here, we just print dummy messages).
*   The `@cl.data_layer` decorator tells Chainlit to call the `get_my_data_layer` function to get the data persistence object it should use.
*   Now, when `cl.Message(...).send()` happens, Chainlit will call `MyCustomDataLayer.create_step` internally.

**When to use custom:** Only if the managed options (`DATABASE_URL`, `LITERAL_API_KEY`) don't meet your specific storage needs. It's significantly more work.

## Under the Hood: How Managed Persistence Works (`ChainlitDataLayer`)

Let's trace what happens when you send a message using the managed database layer (`DATABASE_URL` is set).

1.  **User Sends Message:** User types "Hi" and hits Enter.
2.  **Backend Receives:** Chainlit backend gets the message event.
3.  **`@cl.on_message` Triggered:** Your decorated function (e.g., `main`) runs.
4.  **`cl.Message(...).send()` Called:** Your code prepares a reply and calls `await reply_message.send()`.
5.  **Internal Check for Data Layer:** Inside the `.send()` method (specifically in an internal `_create()` method called by `.send()`), Chainlit calls `get_data_layer()`.
6.  **`get_data_layer()` Finds `ChainlitDataLayer`:** Because `DATABASE_URL` is set, `get_data_layer()` (in `backend/chainlit/data/__init__.py`) initializes and returns an instance of `ChainlitDataLayer`.
7.  **Persistence Call:** The `_create()` method calls `data_layer.create_step(step_dict)` passing the details of the message (messages are represented as 'steps' internally for persistence).
8.  **Database Interaction:** The `ChainlitDataLayer.create_step` method (in `backend/chainlit/data/chainlit_data_layer.py`) connects to your database (using the `DATABASE_URL`) and executes an SQL `INSERT` or `UPDATE` command to save the message details into the appropriate database table (e.g., a `steps` table).
9.  **UI Update:** Separately, the message data is also sent to the user interface via the [Emitter](08_emitter.md) to be displayed.
10. **Loading History:** When a user reconnects, Chainlit uses methods like `data_layer.get_thread(thread_id)` to execute SQL `SELECT` queries, retrieve the saved steps and elements from the database, and reconstruct the conversation history.

Here's a simplified sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant YourAppCode as Your @on_message
    participant MsgSend as cl.Message.send()
    participant GetDataLayer as chainlit.get_data_layer()
    participant DBDataLayer as ChainlitDataLayer
    participant Database

    User->>YourAppCode: Sends message "Hi"
    YourAppCode->>MsgSend: Calls await cl.Message("Reply").send()
    MsgSend->>GetDataLayer: Checks if data layer exists
    GetDataLayer-->>MsgSend: Returns ChainlitDataLayer instance (found DATABASE_URL)
    MsgSend->>DBDataLayer: Calls data_layer.create_step(message_details)
    DBDataLayer->>Database: Connects and runs SQL INSERT/UPDATE
    Database-->>DBDataLayer: Confirms save
    DBDataLayer-->>MsgSend: Returns (persistence complete)
    MsgSend->>User: Sends message to UI via Emitter (separate path)
```

**Code Dive (Simplified):**

*   **`backend/chainlit/data/__init__.py` (`get_data_layer`)**: This function decides which data layer to use.

    ```python
    # Simplified from backend/chainlit/data/__init__.py
    import os
    _data_layer = None
    _data_layer_initialized = False

    def get_data_layer():
        global _data_layer, _data_layer_initialized
        if not _data_layer_initialized:
            # ... (check config.code.data_layer for @cl.data_layer hook) ...
            if database_url := os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"):
                from .chainlit_data_layer import ChainlitDataLayer
                # If DATABASE_URL is set, use the built-in DB layer
                _data_layer = ChainlitDataLayer(database_url=database_url)
            elif api_key := os.environ.get("LITERAL_API_KEY"):
                from .literalai import LiteralDataLayer
                # If LITERAL_API_KEY is set, use the Literal AI layer
                _data_layer = LiteralDataLayer(api_key=api_key)
            # ...
            _data_layer_initialized = True
        return _data_layer
    ```

*   **`backend/chainlit/data/chainlit_data_layer.py` (`create_step`)**: This method handles saving steps (like messages) to the database.

    ```python
    # Simplified from backend/chainlit/data/chainlit_data_layer.py
    import asyncpg # Library for talking to PostgreSQL

    class ChainlitDataLayer(BaseDataLayer):
        def __init__(self, database_url, ...):
            self.database_url = database_url
            self.pool = None # Database connection pool

        async def connect(self):
            if not self.pool:
                self.pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(self.database_url)

        @queue_until_user_message() # Decorator to optimize writes
        async def create_step(self, step_dict: "StepDict"):
            if not self.pool: await self.connect()

            # Simplified representation of SQL query
            query = """
            INSERT INTO "Step" (id, "threadId", name, type, output, ...)
            VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, ...)
            ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET ...
            """
            params = { # Prepare parameters from step_dict
                "id": step_dict["id"],
                "thread_id": step_dict.get("threadId"),
                "name": step_dict.get("name"),
                "type": step_dict["type"],
                "output": step_dict.get("output"),
                # ... other fields ...
            }
            async with self.pool.acquire() as connection:
                await connection.execute(query, *params.values())
                # Actual implementation uses .fetch() or similar

        # ... other methods like get_thread, update_thread (using SQL SELECT) ...
    ```

*   **`backend/chainlit/data/base.py` (`BaseDataLayer`)**: This abstract base class defines the *interface* (the required methods) that any data layer, whether built-in or custom, must implement.

This underlying system ensures that whether you use the managed option or build a custom one, Chainlit knows how to interact with it to save and load your application's data.

## Conclusion

The **Data Layer** is Chainlit's mechanism for giving your application long-term memory. It allows you to persist chat threads, messages, user info, and feedback, enabling crucial features like chat history and user accounts.

You learned about the two main approaches:
*   **Managed Data Layer:** The easy way, using environment variables like `DATABASE_URL` or `LITERAL_API_KEY`, where Chainlit handles persistence automatically.
*   **Custom Data Layer:** The flexible way, using the `@cl.data_layer` decorator and implementing the `BaseDataLayer` interface for full control over storage.

For most users, especially beginners, setting up a managed data layer is the simplest path to enabling persistent chat history.

Now that we understand how data can be saved and loaded, how does Chainlit manage the real-time communication between the backend (where your Python code runs) and the frontend (the chat interface in the user's browser)? How are messages, steps, and elements actually sent across? That's the job of our next component.
