# Chapter 8: Data Layer

Welcome to the final chapter of our beginner tutorial! In [Chapter 7: Emitter](07_emitter.md), we saw how Chainlit sends information from the backend to the user's browser in real-time using the Emitter. We've covered how to build interactive chat flows, manage user sessions, and configure our app.

But what happens when a user closes their browser tab? All the chat history and the state stored in `cl.user_session` are usually lost. What if we want to save the conversation so the user can come back later and continue where they left off? Or what if we want to permanently store user feedback or details about the steps the bot took?

**Motivation: Remembering Conversations Forever**

Imagine building a helpful research assistant bot. A user might have a long conversation, exploring different topics, asking the bot to find information, and maybe even giving feedback on how helpful the answers were.

If the user accidentally closes the browser or needs to step away and come back tomorrow, they'd want to see their previous conversation history and maybe even resume the chat. Without a way to permanently store this data, the conversation would be lost.

We need a mechanism to save the chat threads, user information, messages, steps, attached elements, and feedback somewhere durable – a place that survives browser closes and server restarts. This is the job of the **Data Layer**.

**Use Case: The Persistent Chatbot**

Let's imagine our goal is to make any Chainlit bot we build capable of:
1.  Automatically saving the entire conversation history (messages, steps, elements).
2.  Allowing users to see their past conversations when they revisit the app.
3.  Letting users resume a specific conversation thread.

This requires connecting our Chainlit app to a persistent storage system.

**Key Concepts: The Filing Cabinet for Your App**

1.  **What is the Data Layer?**

    Think of the Data Layer as the **filing cabinet** for your Chainlit application. It's an abstraction – a standardized way for Chainlit to interact with different storage systems without needing to know the specific details of each one. Its job is to provide functions for saving (`persist`) and retrieving (`retrieve`) all the important pieces of a conversation:
    *   Chat Threads (the overall conversation container)
    *   User Information (if authentication is used)
    *   Messages and Steps (the back-and-forth, including thinking steps)
    *   Elements (files, images attached to messages)
    *   Feedback (user ratings/comments on messages)

2.  **Storage Backends: Where the Files Go**

    Just like a real filing cabinet can be made of wood or metal, the Data Layer can use different underlying storage systems (backends). Chainlit has built-in support for several common options:
    *   **Literal AI:** A platform specifically designed for LLM observability and data management. If you use Literal AI, Chainlit can automatically log all conversation data there.
    *   **SQLAlchemy:** Allows you to connect to various SQL databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) using the popular SQLAlchemy library. Chainlit can create the necessary tables and store data there.
    *   **DynamoDB:** A NoSQL database service from AWS.
    *   **(None):** If no data layer is configured, Chainlit doesn't save anything permanently (data only lives in memory for the duration of the session).

3.  **Configuration: Choosing Your Filing Cabinet**

    How do you tell Chainlit which storage backend to use? Usually, you don't write Python code for this. You configure it using **environment variables** when you run your Chainlit application.

    For example, to use Literal AI, you might set the `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable. To use a SQL database, you'd set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with the connection string for your database.

    ```bash
    # Example: Running Chainlit with Literal AI persistence
    export LITERAL_API_KEY="your_literal_api_key"
    chainlit run your_app.py

    # Example: Running Chainlit with a PostgreSQL database
    export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:port/dbname"
    chainlit run your_app.py
    ```
    Chainlit automatically detects these environment variables at startup and initializes the corresponding Data Layer implementation.

4.  **Automatic Saving: Chainlit Does the Filing!**

    Here's the best part for beginners: If you have configured a data layer (like setting `DATABASE_URL`), **Chainlit automatically handles saving the data**.

    When you do things like:
    *   `await cl.Message(...).send()`
    *   `async with cl.Step(...)` finishing
    *   `await cl.Element(...).send()`
    *   Receiving user feedback

    Chainlit's internal code will *automatically* call the appropriate methods on the configured Data Layer (e.g., `create_step`, `create_element`, `upsert_feedback`) to save the relevant information to your chosen backend (Literal AI, SQL DB, etc.). You don't need to add extra saving code in your main application logic (`your_app.py`).

5.  **Custom Implementation: Building Your Own Cabinet**

    What if the built-in options don't fit your needs? Maybe you want to store data in a specific format, use a different database (like MongoDB), or add custom logic during saving/loading. Chainlit allows you to provide your *own* custom data layer implementation.

    You do this by:
    *   Creating a Python class that inherits from `chainlit.data.BaseDataLayer` and implements its methods (like `create_step`, `get_thread`, etc.).
    *   Using the `@cl.data_layer` decorator on a function that returns an instance of your custom class.

    ```python
    # Example of defining a custom (dummy) data layer
    from chainlit.data import BaseDataLayer
    import chainlit as cl

    class MyCustomDataLayer(BaseDataLayer):
        # --- Implement all required methods ---
        async def create_step(self, step_dict: dict):
            print(f"My Custom DL: Pretending to save step {step_dict.get('id')}")
            # Add logic here to save to your custom storage
            pass

        async def get_thread(self, thread_id: str):
            print(f"My Custom DL: Pretending to load thread {thread_id}")
            # Add logic here to load from your custom storage
            return None # Return a ThreadDict or None

        # ... implement other methods like get_user, create_element, etc. ...
        async def get_user(self, identifier: str): pass
        async def create_user(self, user: "User"): pass
        async def delete_feedback(self, feedback_id: str): pass
        async def upsert_feedback(self, feedback: Feedback): pass
        async def create_element(self, element: "Element"): pass
        async def get_element(self, thread_id: str, element_id: str): pass
        async def delete_element(self, element_id: str, thread_id: Optional[str] = None): pass
        async def update_step(self, step_dict: "StepDict"): pass
        async def delete_step(self, step_id: str): pass
        async def get_thread_author(self, thread_id: str): return ""
        async def delete_thread(self, thread_id: str): pass
        async def list_threads(self, pagination: "Pagination", filters: "ThreadFilter"): return PaginatedResponse(pageInfo=PageInfo(hasNextPage=False), data=[])
        async def update_thread(self, thread_id: str, name: Optional[str] = None, user_id: Optional[str] = None, metadata: Optional[Dict] = None, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None): pass
        async def build_debug_url(self) -> str: return ""


    @cl.data_layer
    def get_my_data_layer():
      """This function is called by Chainlit to get the data layer instance."""
      print("Initializing My Custom Data Layer...")
      return MyCustomDataLayer()

    # --- Your regular Chainlit app code ---
    @cl.on_chat_start
    async def start():
      await cl.Message(content="Chat started!").send()

    @cl.on_message
    async def message(msg: cl.Message):
      await cl.Message(content="Processing...").send()

    ```
    *   The `@cl.data_layer` decorator tells Chainlit to call `get_my_data_layer()` to get the data persistence handler.
    *   This is more advanced and usually not needed if the built-in options work for you.

**Solving the Use Case: The Persistent Chatbot**

To make our chatbot persistent and allow users to resume conversations, we typically only need to configure one of the built-in data layers. Let's say we choose to use a PostgreSQL database.

1.  **Set Environment Variable:** Before running the app, we set the `DATABASE_URL`.
    ```bash
    export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://myuser:mypass@localhost:5432/mydatabase"
    ```

2.  **Run Chainlit:**
    ```bash
    chainlit run your_app.py -w
    ```

3.  **Interact:** Use the chat application normally. Send messages, maybe attach files if the app supports it.

**What Happens Now?**

*   Because `DATABASE_URL` is set, Chainlit initializes its built-in SQLAlchemy data layer.
*   Every time a message is sent, a step completes, or an element is created, Chainlit *automatically* calls methods like `data_layer.create_step(...)` behind the scenes.
*   The SQLAlchemy data layer takes this information and saves it as rows in the appropriate tables in your PostgreSQL database.
*   When the user closes the app and comes back later, Chainlit uses the data layer's `list_threads` and `get_thread` methods to fetch the past conversations for that user (if authentication is set up) or allows resuming specific threads by their ID.

**Crucially, we didn't need to change our `your_app.py` code at all!** The persistence is handled automatically by Chainlit and the configured data layer.

**How It Works Internally (Simplified)**

Let's see how sending a message changes when a data layer is active.

1.  **Code Calls `.send()`:** Your Python code calls `await cl.Message(content="Hello").send()`.
2.  **Context Check:** The `send()` method gets the current `Context`.
3.  **Data Layer Check:** It checks if a data layer is configured and available via `context.data_layer`. Let's assume our SQLAlchemy layer is active.
4.  **Prepare Data:** The `Message` object converts itself into a dictionary (`StepDict`) suitable for storage.
5.  **Call Data Layer:** Before (or sometimes after) sending the message to the UI via the [Emitter](07_emitter.md), the `send()` method calls the data layer's persistence method, for example: `await context.data_layer.create_step(message_dict)`.
6.  **Database Interaction:** The `SQLAlchemyDataLayer.create_step` method takes the dictionary, constructs an SQL `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement, and executes it against the configured database (defined by `DATABASE_URL`).
7.  **UI Update:** The message is also sent to the UI via the Emitter as usual.

Here's a sequence diagram illustrating this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant YourAppCode as Your App Code
    participant MessageObj as cl.Message Object
    participant Context as Chainlit Context
    participant DataLayer as Configured Data Layer (e.g., SQLAlchemy)
    participant Database as External Database
    participant Emitter as Chainlit Emitter
    participant BrowserUI as Browser UI

    YourAppCode->>MessageObj: Creates cl.Message("Hello")
    YourAppCode->>MessageObj: Calls await message.send()

    MessageObj->>Context: Gets current context
    MessageObj->>MessageObj: Prepares message data (dict)

    alt Data Layer Configured
        MessageObj->>DataLayer: Accesses context.data_layer
        MessageObj->>DataLayer: Calls data_layer.create_step(message_dict)
        DataLayer->>Database: Executes SQL INSERT/UPDATE statement
        Database-->>DataLayer: Confirms success
    end

    MessageObj->>Emitter: Accesses context.emitter
    MessageObj->>Emitter: Calls emitter.send_step(message_dict)
    Emitter->>BrowserUI: Sends message data via WebSocket
    BrowserUI->>BrowserUI: Renders message
```

**Deeper Dive (Code References)**

*   **`chainlit/data/__init__.py`**:
    *   `get_data_layer()`: This crucial function is called internally to get the active data layer instance. It checks environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `LITERAL_API_KEY`) to initialize built-in layers or calls the function decorated with `@cl.data_layer` if provided.
    *   It initializes clients for storage (S3, GCS, Azure) if configured alongside `DATABASE_URL`.

*   **`chainlit/data/base.py`**:
    *   `BaseDataLayer`: Defines the abstract base class (the "contract") that all data layer implementations must adhere to. It lists all the methods required for persisting and retrieving data (e.g., `create_step`, `update_step`, `get_thread`, `list_threads`, `create_element`, `upsert_feedback`, `get_user`, `create_user`).
    *   `@queue_until_user_message()`: A decorator used on some methods (like `create_step`, `create_element`) to potentially batch operations until a user message requires flushing the queue, optimizing database interactions.

*   **`chainlit/data/chainlit_data_layer.py` / `literalai.py` / `dynamodb.py` / `sql_alchemy.py`**:
    *   These files contain the concrete implementations of `BaseDataLayer` for the built-in backends. They translate the abstract calls (like `create_step`) into specific database operations (SQL queries, Literal AI API calls, DynamoDB commands).

*   **`chainlit/message.py` / `chainlit/step.py` / `element.py` / `action.py`**:
    *   The `.send()`, `.update()`, `.remove()`, and `__aexit__` (for `async with cl.Step`) methods in these classes contain logic that checks `if context.data_layer:` and, if true, calls the appropriate methods like `context.data_layer.create_step(self.to_dict())` or `context.data_layer.create_element(self)`.

*   **`chainlit/callbacks.py`**:
    *   `@cl.data_layer`: The decorator definition. It simply registers the decorated function in `config.code.data_layer`. The `get_data_layer()` function in `chainlit/data/__init__.py` then calls this registered function to get the custom data layer instance.

**Conclusion**

The Data Layer is Chainlit's powerful abstraction for **persistent storage**. It acts like a standardized filing cabinet, allowing Chainlit to save and retrieve conversation threads, messages, steps, elements, feedback, and user information.

*   You typically **configure** it using environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `LITERAL_API_KEY`) rather than writing code.
*   If configured, Chainlit **automatically** saves data to the chosen backend (SQL, Literal AI, DynamoDB) when messages are sent, steps complete, etc.
*   This enables features like **resuming conversations** across sessions.
*   For advanced needs, you can implement a **custom data layer** using the `BaseDataLayer` class and the `@cl.data_layer` decorator.

By providing this abstraction, Chainlit makes it easy to add robust persistence to your conversational applications, enhancing the user experience and enabling long-term data analysis.

This concludes our beginner's journey through the core concepts of Chainlit! We hope these chapters have given you a solid foundation to start building your own amazing chat applications. Happy coding!
